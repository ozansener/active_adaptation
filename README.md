# active_adaptation
## Rough Plan
- Implement adverserial Lavg -> Lmax
- Robust optimization experiment
- Active learning experiment
- ICML? Feb 24!!!!
- Figure out the theory part of domain adaptation stuff
- Domain adaptation experiment
- Active domain adaptation experiment
- ICCV? March 17
- RL experiment with robots
- Counter-Factual learning
- NIPS? May 20?

## Jan 20
- <del>Cifar10 training and test (full data/nothing new using tf_base)</del>
- <del>Set the seed training_set and save it num_images = 5000</del>
- Random active learning test <del>0.1/0.2/0.3/</del>0.4/0.5/0.6/0.7/0.8/0.9/<del>1.0</del>
- Plot the accuracy vs training data (baseline 1)

## Jan 21
- L_avg -> L_max experiment with the same setup 
- No random selection, just a sampling w/ replacement
- Plot the accuracy vs training data (baseline 2)

## Jan 22
- Sample new data with the learned model
- Plot the accuracy vs training data (proposed model)


## Device Assignment
- 109 5k/10k/15k/20k
- 110 25k/30k/35k/40k

# TODO
- Figure out what's happening if there is dropout
