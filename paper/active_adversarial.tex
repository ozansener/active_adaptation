%\documentstyle[icml2017,epsf,natbib]{article}
% If you rely on Latex2e packages, like most moden people use this:

% use Times
\usepackage{times}
% For figures
\usepackage{graphicx} % more modern
%\usepackage{epsfig} % less modern

% For citations
\usepackage{natbib}

% For algorithms
\usepackage{algorithm}

% As of 2011, we use the hyperref package to produce hyperlinks in the

\usepackage{hyperref}

% Packages hyperref and algorithmic misbehave sometimes.  We can fix

\newcommand{\theHalgorithm}{\arabic{algorithm}}

% Employ the following version of the ``usepackage'' statement for

\section{Weakly Supervised Learning with Adversery}
\subsection{Problem Definition - Active Learning with a Pool}
Simple notation
\subsection{Adversarial Learning as a Weak Supervision}
Just give probability ratio and explain why it makes to use it as a scale
\section{Active Learning as a Space Covering}
Just explain we will first understand theory then will explain the method inspired by it
\subsection{Analysis of Test Error for Active Learning}
\subsubsection{Robustness and Generalization}
Summary of classical results
\subsubsection{Extension of Classical Results to Active Deep Learning}
\begin{itemize}
\item Theorem 1. Every robust algorithm is robust with subset with closeness approximation
\item Proposition 1. A network with k layer of Conv+MaxPool+ReLu and d layer of FC is robust
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Active Learning Method}
Key idea: we need labelled points to cover the space so i) make distributions closer and ii) choose active points such that $\gamma$ is minimized
\section{Summary of the Algorithm with Implementation Details}
Give the algorithm in algorithmic format with full details
\section{Experiments}
Compare with state-of-the-art weak supervision and active learning
\section{Electronic Submission}

\subsection{Algorithms}

If you are using \LaTeX, please use the ``algorithm'' and ``algorithmic'' 
environments to format pseudocode. These require 
the corresponding stylefiles, algorithm.sty and 
algorithmic.sty, which are supplied with this package. 
Algorithm~\ref{alg:example} shows an example. 

\begin{algorithm}[tb]
   \caption{Bubble Sort}
   \label{alg:example}
\begin{algorithmic}
   \STATE {\bfseries Input:} data $x_i$, size $m$
   \REPEAT
   \STATE Initialize $noChange = true$.
   \FOR{$i=1$ {\bfseries to} $m-1$}
   \IF{$x_i > x_{i+1}$} 
   \STATE Swap $x_i$ and $x_{i+1}$
   \STATE $noChange = false$
   \ENDIF
   \ENDFOR
   \UNTIL{$noChange$ is $true$}
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
 
\subsection{Tables} 
% Note use of \abovespace and \belowspace to get reasonable spacing 
% above and below tabular lines. 

\begin{table}[t]
\caption{Classification accuracies for naive Bayes and flexible 
Bayes on various data sets.}

\subsection{Citations and References} 

Please use APA reference format regardless of your formatter
or word processor. If you rely on the \LaTeX\/ bibliographic 
facility, use {\tt natbib.sty} and {\tt icml2017.bst} 
included in the style-file package to obtain this format.

Citations within the text should include the authors' last names and
year. If the authors' names are included in the sentence, place only
the year in parentheses, for example when referencing Arthur Samuel's
pioneering work \yrcite{Samuel59}. Otherwise place the entire
reference in parentheses with the authors and year separated by a
comma \cite{Samuel59}. List multiple references separated by
semicolons \cite{kearns89,Samuel59,mitchell80}. Use the `et~al.'
construct only for citations with three or more authors or after
listing all authors to a publication in an earlier reference \cite{MachineLearningI}.

Use an unnumbered first-level section heading for the references, and 
use a hanging indent style, with the first line of the reference flush
against the left margin and subsequent lines indented by 10 points. 
The references at the end of this document give examples for journal
articles \cite{Samuel59}, conference publications \cite{langley00}, book chapters \cite{Newell81}, books \cite{DudaHart2nd}, edited volumes \cite{MachineLearningI}, 
technical reports \cite{mitchell80}, and dissertations \cite{kearns89}.
